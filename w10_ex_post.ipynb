    "outside the labour market, unemployed or employed. This model is a\n",
    "generalization of the logit model we looked at in problem set 9 (binary\n",
    "choice) which only allowed for the dependent variable to have two\n",
    "discrete outcomes.\n",

    "The dataset consists of two things for each $i$, $(y_i, \\mathbf{x}_i)$, \n",

    "that the error terms $\\varepsilon_{ij}$ are not in the dataset. \n",
